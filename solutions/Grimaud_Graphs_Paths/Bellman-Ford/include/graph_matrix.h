/**
 * @file graph_matrix.h
 *
 * @brief Definitions and functions for graph representation and manipulation using adjacency matrices.
 * 
 * This header file contains the definitions of structures and declarations of functions for handling graphs
 * represented by adjacency matrices. It includes functions for creating and deleting graphs, as well as 
 * printing the adjacency matrix and the shortest path matrices computed by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
 * 
 * Structures:
 * - `graph_s`: Represents a graph with its properties and matrices.
 * - `edge_s`: Represents an edge in the graph with source, destination, and weight.
 * 
 * Functions:
 * - `create_graph`: Creates a graph with specified vertices, edges, and directed property.
 * - `delete_graph`: Frees the resources associated with a graph.
 * - `print`: Prints the adjacency matrix of the graph.
 * - `print_matrix`: Prints a given matrix in a formatted way.
